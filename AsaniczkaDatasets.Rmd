## Data cleanup

Dataset 1: Year 2024

```{r}
#Import the files

# Count unique job levels and their frequencies

  group_by(job_level) %>%
  summarise(count = n()) %>%
  arrange(desc(count))

print(df2_job_level_counts)

# Separate multiple skills into individual rows
df2_job_skills_counts <- df2 %>%
  separate_rows(job_skills, sep = ",") %>% 
  mutate(job_skills = str_remove_all(job_skills, "\\*") %>% trimws(),  # Remove "*" and trim spaces

  coord_flip() +  # Flip axis for better readability
  labs(title = "Top 25 Job Skills Frequency",
       x = "Job Skill",
       y = "Count") +

```

Dataset 2: Year 2023
```{r}

```

Combine the counts for the job skills

```{r}
# Merge the two dataframes on job_skills
combined_job_skills <- full_join(df2_job_skills_counts, df3_job_skills_counts, 
                                        by = "job_skills", suffix = c("_df2", "_df3"))

# Replace NA values with 0 and sum the counts
combined_job_skills_counts <- combined_job_skills %>%
  mutate(count_df2 = ifelse(is.na(count_df2), 0, count_df2),
         count_df3 = ifelse(is.na(count_df3), 0, count_df3),
         total_count = count_df2 + count_df3) %>%
  select(job_skills, total_count) %>%
  arrange(desc(total_count))

# Display the top job skills
head(combined_job_skills_counts)

#Plot top 25 combined skills
ggplot(combined_job_skills_counts %>% slice_max(total_count, n = 25), aes(x = reorder(job_skills, total_count), y = total_count)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "gray") +
  coord_flip() +  # Flip axis for better readability
  labs(title = "Top 25 Job Skills Frequency",
       x = "Job Skill",
       y = "Count") +
  theme_minimal()


```

Difference between the two data sets. This will show the increase or decrease in the job skills from 2023 to 2024.
```{r}

         count_df3 = ifelse(is.na(count_df3), 0, count_df3),
         total_count = count_df2 - count_df3) %>%
  select(job_skills, total_count) %>%
  arrange(desc(total_count))

# Select the top 25 positive and negative total_count values
top_positive <- difference_job_skills_counts %>% slice_max(total_count, n = 25)
top_negative <- difference_job_skills_counts %>% slice_min(total_count, n = 25)

# Table for positive changes
table_positive <- top_positive %>%
  select(job_skills, total_count) %>%
  rename("Job Skill" = job_skills, "Increase in Frequency" = total_count)

       x = "Job Skill",
       y = "Increase in Frequency") +
